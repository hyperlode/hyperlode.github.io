                <h1>Set House Rules</h1>

                <h2>Why House Rules:</h2>
                <p>
                    The original SET rules are as simple as they are confusing: "Lay out twelve cards on the table. If a
                    player finds a SET, the dealer replaces the three cards with new ones. If no sets are found, the
                    dealer adds more cards". This proved to be pretty unplayable: What to do when a set is found during
                    laying on the table? What if a player calls a set that's not there? How are scores kept? What if the
                    dealer's card flipping technique is so bad, some players already see the SET before anyone else?
                    During a year of playing during lunch break, the rules were fine-tuned until heated discussions are
                    a rare occurrence.
                </p>

                <h2>Rules:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Divide the cards into as many piles as there are players. (No need to perfectly deal the cards,
                        just make piles that feel equal).</li>
                    <li>Each player gets a pile.</li>
                    <li>Each in turn (clockwise), when a player feels like it, they move a still-hidden card to the
                        middle of the table, in the grid with other cards, and flip it according to the flip rules.
                        (Flip rules: swift, quick flip where ideally everyone sees the front face of the card at the
                        same time).</li>
                    <li>As the grid contains more cards, arranged neatly in rows and columns, as square as possible, all
                        players search for a SET.</li>
                    <li>If a set is found at any time, the finding player yells "SET" and points out the three SET
                        cards.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If there is indeed a SET, the player receives one of the three cards that makes up the set
                            as "A POINT". The two remaining cards are stashed in the bank.</li>
                        <li>If there is no SET, the cards are left on the table, and the SET caller has to give one of
                            their points-cards to the bank.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the player has no points cards, they cannot yell SET until another player has yelled
                                SET.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>If a player takes too long to point out the three SET cards, another player can take one of
                            their set point cards. If that card hits the bank before the player correctly points out the
                            three cards, other players can yell SET again.</li>
                        <li>If multiple players yell SET at the same time, the remaining players figure out who was
                            first. If no consensus is found, both SET callers get a point. If one fails to point out the
                            set, they give up one point, and the other player must point it out.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>(Simultaneous sets can cause discussions. Ideally, we have a voice recorder that can replay the
                        sound in slow motion, like an auditive photo finish. Alternatively, a button press or a slam on
                        the deck can be used to indicate a SET).</p>

                    <li><strong>Super Round:</strong> At any point before a flip, a player can call a super round. Other
                        players can join or not. During the next flip, the super round players have ten seconds to
                        themselves, while non-super round players count down from ten and cannot yell SET.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If during these ten seconds a super round player yells SET and points it out correctly, they
                            get all three SET cards as points.</li>
                        <li>If they cannot point out the SET, they lose two points.</li>
                        <li>When the ten seconds pass, every super round player who did not find a SET pays one of their
                            set points to the bank.</li>
                        <li>The game resumes, and everyone can yell SET again, following the normal rules.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Super rounds are mostly used when:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The game nears its end, and players who are behind want a fighting chance.</li>
                        <li>There are many cards on the table, making the next flip likely to reveal an obvious SET.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><em>Debatable Rule:</em> Sets found during the super round must include the just-flipped card.
                        Some players may prefer the challenge, while others feel it's unnecessary. If other players
                        suspect you of calling a super round because you know there's already a SET, they can still call
                        SET before the flip.</p>
                </ol> -->

                <h2>Why We Created Our Rules</h2>
                <p>
                    The original SET rules are as simple as they are confusing: "Lay out twelve cards on the table. If a
                    player finds a SET, the dealer replaces the three cards with new ones. If no sets are found, the
                    dealer adds more cards." These rules left many details unclear, making the game difficult to play
                    smoothly. For instance: What happens if a SET is found while laying out cards? How should we handle
                    false SET calls? How are points scored? And what if the dealer’s flip technique gives some players
                    an advantage?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the course of a year playing during lunch breaks, we refined the rules to make gameplay more
                    enjoyable and eliminate confusion. And don't worry, even with these rules there's still plenty of room for heated debates! That's what SET does to you!
                </p>

                <h2>Super Rules</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Every player a dealer:</strong> Divide the deck into piles for each player. Each player gets a pile to draw from. (No need for
                        precise dealing; just roughly equal piles.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Turn based:</strong> Going clockwise, when a player is ready, he takes a card off his
                        stack, moves it face down to a free spot on the card grid and flips it. Ideally, all players see
                        the card face at the same time. Flipping technique is not to be underestimated. Bad flippers can
                        be called out and booed! If bad flipping persists, they might lose their flipping privileges.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Eternal SET searching:</strong> Everyone looks continuously for a SET.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>SET Found:</strong> At any point, if a player spots a SET, they shout "SET" and
                        point out the three SET cards.
                        <ul>
                            <li>If they correctly identified a SET, they take one of the three cards as a point, while
                                the remaining two cards go to the discard pile.</li>
                            <li>If they were mistaken, the cards stay on the table, and the SET caller must put one of
                                their points on the discard pile. If they have no points, they cannot call SET again
                                until another player has correctly identified one.</li>
                            <li>If the SET caller delays pointing out the SET (suggesting they may have made an
                                error), another player may take one of their points to put it in the discard pile. If
                                that point card touches the pile before the SET is pointed out, the point is lost and
                                anyone can call SET
                                again (including the player that just lost a point).</li>
                            <li> If multiple players call SET at the same time, the others decide who was first. If no
                                agreement is reached, both players earn a point. However, if one cannot identify the
                                SET, they give up a point, and the other player must identify it correctly.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>(Simultaneous SET calls can spark debates. Ideally, we would use a voice recorder to review
                            audio or implement a button press or table slam to mark the first caller.)</p>
                        <p> Tip: An alternative to yelling SET is to touch one of the three cards of a SET. Touching it
                            first is equivalent to yelling SET.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Super Round:</strong> At any time before a flip, a player can call a super round. Other
                        players may choose to join or not.
                        <ul>
                            <li>A super round starts with the next card flip. It implies that participating players have ten seconds during which only they can call SET while the other players count down the seconds.</li>
                            <li>If a super round player calls SET during this period and correctly points it out, they
                                receive all three SET cards as points.</li>
                            <li>If they cannot show a valid SET, they lose two points.</li>
                            <li>After ten seconds, if no SET has been identified, each super round player who couldn’t
                                find a SET must pay one point to the bank.</li>
                            <li>The game then resumes with everyone eligible to call SET as usual.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Super rounds are useful when:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The game is close to ending, and a player wants a last chance to catch up on points.
                            </li>
                            <li>There are many cards on the table, and the next flip is likely to reveal a SET easily.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><em>Debatable Rule:</em> Must a SET found during a super round include the
                            just-flipped card? If not, a player how sees a SET can pretend like he doesn't and call super round to capitalize on it...IF other players don't see the SET in the meantime of course.</p>
                    </li>

                        <strong>Comments:</strong> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>It's good to store points face up, to not confuse the pile with a player's draw pile.</li>
                            <li>As the cards from a SET get split up (point cards, discard cards), the discard pile and points pile are shuffled by default. A new game of SET does not need cards to be shuffled extensively!</li>
                            <li>One round per games night / lunch is recommended. When a full game is played, often the mood is good and the adrenalinen high. The mistake is made to play another round. Halfway that round the momentum is lost and people are fed up with it. </li>
                        </ul>
